    "# Audio Training in 5 Cells (Single Config File)\n",
    "This notebook uses only one config: `configs/master_config.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- No extra config files are created.\n",
    "- Training/eval/export always read from `configs/master_config.json`.\n",
    "- To change parameters, edit that one file directly, then rerun cells 2-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision rule:\n",
    "- Accept model if `F1_DEFECT >= 0.70` and `RECALL_DEFECT >= 0.80` on your evaluation script.\n",
    "- Otherwise improve data quality/split policy first, then revisit parameters."
